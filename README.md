# IoT Community SDK

This is a sample repository to demonstrate the RIDDLE&CODE Secure Element Community edition and the trezor crypto library with the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 DK.
The goal of this sample code is to show how to easily set up bitcoin key creation and maintenance on an embedded device.

A step-by-step guideline will guide through the set up process for the board and the Arduino IDE. 
Thereafter, a short sample shows what can be achieved on that very board easily.

## Set up the board


1. Download and install the Arduino IDE (At least v1.6.12)
2. Start the Arduino IDE
3. Go into Preferences
4. Add https://sandeepmistry.github.io/arduino-nRF5/package_nRF5_boards_index.json as an "Additional Board Manager URL"
5. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install "Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards"
6. Select the  nRF52 DK board from the Tools -> Board menu 

Follow the other OS dependent instructions from https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5 if your device hasn't been flashed before (Note: RIDDLE&CODE usually ships already flashed devices).
